          When I was in 8th grade I was also in track and field. I was also in
          a club where I mentored a 6th grader who was struggling. We would
          meet once or twice a week to go over anything they were strugging 
          with anything. We would also help them keep track of missing
          assignments, quizzes, and tests.
          Some sports that I am involved in are swimming and badminton. 
          I am interested in long boarding and Korean and taught myself how to 
          longboard and the korean characters. 
          I also play the piano and have received the Piano Merit Test 
          Certification for 5 years. I have also received the honor roll all 
          4 times in my 8th grade year.

        <h5 class="card-title"> <font color="4484CE">Career Goal</font></h5>
        <p class="card-text">So far I don't have a job that I am 
        definite on but many I am intersted in. I am interested in becoming 
        either a 3D animator, an environmental engineer, a programmer, 
        a zoologist, or a ___.  
        I believe that all of these jobs will need coding skills.
        By taking this Project Lead the Way course I hope to not only learn and
        better my skills in programming, but narrow down my carrer choices to
        find one I would be the most interested, and best fitted for.</p>

        <p class="card-text">I am creative and have experience using 
        softwares like Procreate for drawing. 
        I also have some coding skills and can write in HTML, Python, and CSS. 
        Although I don’t have much experience with coding I am learning 
        more about coding through Codecademy and a coding app called Mimo.</p>

        <p class="card-text">In middle school I was a member of the 
        California Scholarship and participated in a popsicle fundraiser,
        two flea markets, our Spoken Word Night, our school’s 
        Fallon Night Live, and track meet fundraisers.
        So far, in my freshman year I have created blessings for backpacks for
        a club called Students Taking Active Roles Club. 
        I have also created a poster for the Give Light Club and have 
        volunteered at Fertile GroundWorks.
