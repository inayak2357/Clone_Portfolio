                                <p>From the Scratch project I learned about the
                                logic involved in coding, strings of 
                                information that code for certain things, 
                                and that commenting can help a lot with 
                                figuring out which code does what when a piece 
                                of code breaks. 
                                I also learned perseverance since our story 
                                game that we created for the project included 
                                a lot of sprites and scene changes making it 
                                hard to code for each movement. 
                                Through the Scratch Project I also learned 
                                about partner communication since our project 
                                was done in pairs. Communicating at school and 
                                through phones helped to communicate ideas, 
                                problems, and some possible solutions.

                                    The App Inventor Project helped me learn 
                                patience since many of the features that my 
                                partner and I thought of did not work with 
                                App Inventor. After many trials and errors and 
                                searching up ways to help solve the problem we 
                                found that the feature did not work and found 
                                another way to make the game harder and more 
                                interesting. 
                                I also learned about making my documentation 
                                easier to read and organized so it looks 
                                more professional.
